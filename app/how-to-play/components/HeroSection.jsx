                        The match result is based on the Gameweek score of each team minus any transfer points spent preparing for the Gameweek.
                        3 points are awarded for a win and 1 point for a draw, teams are then ranked on points earned in Head-to-Head matches.
                        Head-to-Head fixtures are generated at the start of the league's first Gameweek.
